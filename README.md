# Obtaining-Photovoltaic-Parameters-for-a-Current-Voltage-Graph

You need to have Octave which is a free to download matlab type software to run the file which can be found here: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

The file that you need to run is this: 
xtilde_yHat_All_Functions_V2lessComments.m
I have other versions but this one might be the tidiest to understand the code.

My data tries to scan the data from an IV-curve but is unsuccessful, I learnt a lot through it, you need to identify points on a graph through the octave editor with the graphs provided, basically it tries to read a file to get 2 parameters of input for current and voltage. I can't upload them because it might be confidential so maybe try to create your own current voltage graphs and adjust the read in file accordingly. I have to create a better user interface but no longer am working on this project. I might try and do it in another way in the future.
